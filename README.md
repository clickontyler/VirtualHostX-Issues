# VirtualHostX Public Issue Tracker
A public issue tracker for [VirtualHostX 7](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/7/)

In an effort to be more transparent about development of VirtualHostX, I'm opening up this GitHub repo so customers can file issues and see the status of where things stand. Feel free to create issues or comment on existing ones. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome.
